# Applications_of_Deep_Neural_Networks

<p>Deep learning is a group of exciting new technologies for neural networks. By using a combination of advanced training techniques, neural network architectural components, it is now possible to train neural networks of much greater complexity. This is an introduction to deep belief neural networks, regularization units (ReLU), convolution neural networks and recurrent neural networks. High performance computing (HPC) aspects will demonstrate how deep learning can be leveraged both on graphical processing units (GPUs), as well as grids. </p>

<p>
Deep learning allows a model to learn hierarchies of information in a way that is similar to the function of the human brain. We will use Google TensorFlow and the Python programming language to architect a deep learning model for several of real-world data sets and interpret the results of these networks.
